The development process for my website was more of an incremental process as I started the foundation of each website first then implemented a basic CSS to show how everything would layout. After, this I had implemented the design scheme I was going against, since my website was going to be a film review website, I had tried to follow the IMDB colour scheme of yellow and black. The main issue I had encountered was the resizing of the navigation bar when I had shrunk the window or using it on a smaller device. Also, the creating of the navigation bar was quite difficult as I tried to broaden my knowledge and attempted to implement the navigation bar in JavaScript, which seems to have worked. Media breakpoints were confusing to get my head around as I had difficulties trying to implement the correct sizes and keep the lining of the images above each other. At first there was no initial idea to have a separate page for user feedback, but then 

In terms of accessibility, I had used 'alt' tags, this is because if the respective image did have any issues with loading then the description of the alt tag will show. Also, I had given contrast between the background and writing, this makes it easier to the read for the user.

Application of JS and CSS?
I had applied JavaScript differently than I would have usually, after research I had found that a navigation bar could be implemented using JavaScript.

User testing?
For user testing, I had told the made a new page called 'Feedback' and within ths page I had called in a Typeform questionnaire I had created. I had shown the website to 20 people, and at the end of the browsing period I had told them to click the feedback link where the questionnaire would initiate. The questionnaire consisted of questions about navigation, layout, and accessibility. From the user feedback, the main issue I had found out was that the description page has images that have an 'ease in' effect, so when the user hovers over the image, the image would push back slightly making the user the think it can be clicked, however it was just an ordinary picture with a figcaption. After this feedback, I had removed this effect. On the other hand, respondents had said that navigating through the website was easy and the navigation bar was not too confusing
